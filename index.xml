      <description>A basic implementation of chess written in C++14. It uses a mixture of bitboards and 0x88 with most information gathered from Chess Programming Wiki. The AI uses minimax with alpha-beta pruning plus an opening book. There is definitely room for improvements wrt. gameplay, performance and presentation.
There is also a short video of it running on an Android phone using Vulkan.
Requires WebGL2.
Controls Use left mouse button to select / deselect a piece.</description>

      <description>This is a test of my physics engine written in C++14 running in the browser using Emscripten / WASM. WebGL2 is required. The yellow entity is connected using a universal joint with two different limits. The three cyan entities are connected using multiple hinges with limits. The blue entity uses a cone joint and is currently still a work in progress.
There is also a short video of it running on Windows 10 using Vulkan.</description>
